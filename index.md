# hello

if you're here for the sketch client for garyc.me, [you got the URL wrong](https://quackbarc.github.io/sketch/).
if you're just curious on what else i've got on this website, i wish you luck on finding anything particularly good.

## garyc-related
* [sketch](https://quackbarc.github.io/sketch/) -- a fork of [dagwaging](https://dagwaging.github.io/sketch/)'s sketch client for garyc.me.
* [garyc-sketch-tweaks](https://github.com/quackbarc/garyc-sketch-tweaks) -- a userscript for garyc.me/sketch with bug fixes and some QoL tweaks.

## other webpages
* [sae](https://quackbarc.github.io/sae "he will dance, you'll see") -- just a funky rainbow dude dancin
* [websafe](https://quackbarc.github.io/dump/websafe) -- finds the closest websafe color of a hex (sort of broken)
